			<p class="about-text"> Internationally recognized as a world-class violinist, singer, composer, author, actor,
				and artist, Emilie Autumn grew up by the sea in California where she mastered the classical violin before
				going on to travel the world as a highly theatrical singer. Known for her genre-bending albums Opheliac and
				Fight Like A Girl, Emilie has also starred in Darren Lynn Bousman’s musical fantasy films The Devil’s
				Carnival and Alleluia! The Devil’s Carnival (alongside Adam Pascal of Broadway’s RENT fame, and Ted Neeley
				of the classic film Jesus Christ Superstar). 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">Emilie’s academic career ended abruptly at the age of ten when, as a child-prodigy
				violinist, she was removed from school to enable her the time to perfect her craft. Yet, despite her
				near-complete absence of formal education, her debut self-published novel (The Asylum for Wayward Victorian
				Girls) is cited in text-books used as part of the psychology curriculum at Oxford University in London,
				amongst other publications. Emilie's poetry, written in her teens, has been used as the basis for original
				works created and publicly performed by New York's Rochester Ballet Company, using her spoken-word and
				classical violin work as the score.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">Emilie originally intended to begin and end her career as a classical soloist and
				composer, but gradually became aware that, in order to express herself completely, she must use her voice as
				well as her fingers. Naturally, once she opened her mouth, she never shut up. Now armed with an electric
				violin, a uniquely powerful singing voice, and self-taught skills as a digital programmer able to record and
				produce her own albums (she has been made an official artist representative for Steinberg's Cubase, the
				industry leading digital recording and programming software), Emilie Autumn was ready to get (very) loud.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">Upon the release of her 2007 Shakespearean-themed concept album, Opheliac, Emilie found
				herself an overnight star in Germany's industrial rock scene, and began touring extensively. With her
				flaming red hair, fetish for tightly-laced corsets, and signature heart painted on her cheek (a unifying
				symbol devotedly replicated by her global audience known as "Plague Rats"), Emilie fast became a sensation
				throughout Europe and the United Kingdom before touring frequently through America, South America, Canada,
				and Russia. During this time, Emilie released several singles, EPs, a cover of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody,"
				and a double-disc album of instrumental work, the violin extravaganza, Laced/Unlaced—one disc featuring her
				classical work, the other her industrial/metal electric violin pyrotechnics.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">Then came the literary creation that would alter the course of Emilie's career and change
				the perception of who she was in the minds of both fans and friends—an illustrated
				autobiographical/historical fantasy novel weighing in at nearly five pounds, entitled, The Asylum for
				Wayward Victorian Girls. Diagnosed first with major depression in her early 20s and later with bipolar
				disorder, Emilie’s novel was culled from the very real pages of the secret journal she kept whilst
				incarcerated in a mental hospital. The tale takes an unexpected turn when, whilst still in the psych ward,
				Emilie discovers evidence of a parallel dimension—a world that soon becomes indiscernible from her own. As
				the days drift on, the seemingly disparate worlds of the story's two lead characters (Emilie and Emily, her
				Victorian counterpart) begin to merge. The Asylum... is a profoundly moving saga of suffering, sisterhood,
				and revenge that has empowered thousands of young readers to victoriously end their battle with self-harm,
				and to create communities wherein the "unique" can support one another and cultivate pride in what makes
				them different. Emilie has held hundreds of book readings and performed scenes from the book around the
				world, often asking her listeners to join in and act out the scenes themselves. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">With the release of the album, Fight Like A Girl, Emilie Autumn pulled her listeners ever
				deeper into the realm of the Asylum, the fantastical alternate reality described in her magnum opus. The
				title track launches the onslaught with an anthem for the underdog, calling upon females of all ages to
				realize they are in fact 51% of the Earth's human population, and to take back their power at all costs.
				From there, the struggle of both modern day and Victorian insane asylum inmates is enacted with Emilie
				taking on the voices of varying characters from her novel, ending in the ultimate fight to the death, "Time
				For Tea," and the universally encouraging message of what it takes to transform from victim to victorious in
				"One Foot In Front Of The Other." Part musical theatre, part industrial rock, part historical horror story,
				on Fight Like A Girl, Emilie makes her Broadway intentions unabashedly clear. Emilie has toured the world in
				support of "FLAG, the highlight being her first appearance in Russia. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text">Since it's release, The Asylum... novel continues to increase in popularity as Plague Rats
				around the globe cover themselves in tattoos from its elaborate art, cosplay as its varied characters (both
				human and animal), write their own fan-fiction, put on their own stage plays taking place in the Asylum
				world, arrange group meet-ups and tea parties, and incorporate Emilie's story into their own lives in
				virtually every imaginable way. Aiding the phenomenon, the famed Vans Warped Tour has featured "Emilie
				Autumn's Asylum Experience," wherein festival-goers enjoyed an interactive, day-long immersive theatre
				installation in Emilie's signature environment. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="about-text bottom-buffer">Emilie is currently at work composing the Broadway musical and film versions
				of The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls, and is constantly releasing music from the musical, most notably
				the new album The Asylum for Wayward Victorian Girls: Behind the Musical, now available everywhere.
